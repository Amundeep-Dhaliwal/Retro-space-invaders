# Retro-space-invaders
Space invaders game that uses object oriented programming

Some additional features that need implementing:
-A more elaborate main menu (currently only one play button).
-Particle effects when you destroy a ship.
-Parallax scrolling background effect

All the music/images are uploaded. Feel free to edit and tweak as you please! I wish to declare that none of these assets are my own.

Any feed back would be much appreciated!
